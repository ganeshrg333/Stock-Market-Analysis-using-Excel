# Stock-Market-Analysis-using-Excel
This is my personal project. In this project I did the analyzation of highest price, lowest price, standard deviation, highest price movement, lowest price movements, average daily volatility, etc. of Stock Market.  As we know excel is also a part of Data Science. So, to enhance my Data Science skills and to gain some knowledge; I decided to do this project.
